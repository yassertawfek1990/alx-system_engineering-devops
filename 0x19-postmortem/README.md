What pingo does
When you have any non-pingo (pingon't) content to share with a only allowed to say pingo community, like a funny story or joke, sharing it just as it is will result in you getting removed from the community! That is where pingo swoops in to save the day, by helping you turn all of your words into pingo! Now your story or joke or whatever is safe to share. A link is also provided, for friends who are in these communities but do not speak fluent pingo, to view the original input. As a bonus, any digit in the input is replaced by 0 to make the output more pingo-like.
